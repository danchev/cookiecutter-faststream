# Cookiecutter Faststream

Cookiecutter template for creating a Faststream project.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this Cookiecutter template, please make sure you have the `uv` package installed. If it's not already installed, you can do so using the following command:

```bassh
# Linux/macOS:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```pwsh
# Windows (PowerShell):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Faststream project using this template, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to generate a new Faststream project:

   ```bash
   uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/danchev/cookiecutter-faststream.git
   ```

   This command will prompt you to provide some information about your project, such as project name, author name, and other configuration options.

3. After you've answered the prompts, Cookiecutter will create a new directory for your Faststream project based on your responses.

4. Inside the newly generated directory, you will find a README file specific to your project. Follow the instructions in that README file to set up and run your Faststream application.

5. That's it! You now have a new Faststream project set up and ready to go. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please refer to the project-specific README file or reach out to the project maintainers.
